# Kivy calculator
## What is it and why did I do it?
<p>Well first of all it is exactly as the name suggests, its a just a simple calculator, however it is done in Kivy library (multiplatform, natively resizable library).</p>
<p>I am completely new to Kivy, so I decided to make this simple small project to get some experience with it, mainly because Kivy has its own language and file type, and I will have to get used to using it.</p>
<p>I will also maybe expand this calculator when I have more experience.</p>
